* [ ]`Please ask a question that you wanna to get an answear.`

He has drawed five Tarot cards for you. 

![Tarot](Tarot.png)


1. **Self** (5 of swords): Before you fight for something, make sure you consider the consequences. When one person seeks to dominate another, both become slaves. This card shows the end results of a battle and nobody seems to be rejoicing. The victor has won, but at what cost? He wanted to dominate and enslave his opponent and he is not happy with the outcome. This card represents a clash of wills, where even the winner does not win. It is an empty victory.
2. **The loved one** (King of wands): Solving problems and manifesting what you desire is the driving force of the King of Wands. He is not just an idea man; he puts his ideas to work. That is what you should do. You will discover that when you are feeling good, you will be more successful, and when you are feeling bad, you will prevent success from manifesting.
3. **Situation** (9 of Swords, reversed): Pay attention to your thinking and use the power of your will to direct it toward more positive pursuits that will take your mind off of worry over things that you can't do anything about. This kind of thinking will drain your energy and result in poor health.
4. **Potential** (7 of Pentacles): Stop and evaluate your progress and appreciate your accomplishments. You have come a long way, so let that inspire you to finish your journey or that project.
5. **Advice or Outcome** (Death): Embracing change will empower you and you will move forward. Resistance will only increase suffering. You can make the hard decisions yourself and have it your way or they will be made for you.

`I'm sure that he will summarize these clues for you.`
